# 🎮 Simon Says Game

A browser-based **Simon Says** game built entirely with **JavaScript**, **jQuery**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. This was created as a personal project to learn and practice core JavaScript concepts and DOM manipulation through jQuery — while having fun building an interactive experience.

## 🧠 About the Project

This game replicates the classic *Simon Says* memory challenge. Each round, the game plays a new color sequence that the player must memorize and repeat. As the levels progress, the sequence becomes longer, putting the player’s memory and focus to the test.

### 🔧 Technologies Used

- HTML5 & CSS3  
- JavaScript (ES6)  
- jQuery 3.x  
- Sound effects (MP3)

## 🚀 How to Play

1. **Start the Game**  
   Press any key to begin. A new color sequence will appear.

2. **Repeat the Pattern**  
   Click the colored buttons in the same order as they flash.

3. **Level Up**  
   If you succeed, the sequence gets longer and the level increases.

4. **Game Over**  
   If you click the wrong button, the game resets. Press any key to try again.

## 💡 Features

- Dynamic game logic with scalable difficulty  
- Sound and visual feedback for each interaction  
- Game over animation and restart functionality  
- Clean and readable code structure for learning purposes

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was developed as part of a self-directed learning journey to gain hands-on experience with JavaScript and jQuery. It combines logic, event handling, and UI/UX feedback to build a complete, interactive mini-game.
